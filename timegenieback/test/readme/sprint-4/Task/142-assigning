Firstly to assigning employees to a project.
You need to log in as a manager.

Use the url: http://localhost:[PORT]/app/project/assign
Set the method to PATCH
In body use this format
    {
        "username": "some user"
        "company": "some company name"
        "project_id": some integer (do not surround the integer in quotations)
    }

If you successfully assign an employee to a project you just get that project you assigned them to back with their
UUID in the "assigned_employees" field.

Next assigning employees to tasks, this one there are two ways to assign, as employees can assign themselves to tasks
or a manager can assign employees to tasks.

Use the url: http://localhost:[PORT]/app/task/assign
For the first one log in as a manager
set the method to PATCH
use the following format
    {
        "username": "some user"
        "company": "some company name"
        "task_id": some integer (do not surround the integer in quotations)
    }

Lastly a user assigning themselves to a task all you need to do is log in and send the following body
    {
        "task_id": some integer (do not surround the integer in quotations)
    }
