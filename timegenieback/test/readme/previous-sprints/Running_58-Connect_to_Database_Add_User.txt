How to run:

Firstly once inside the directory run the following command: npm install

Next creat a .env file inside follow this format:
PORT = your port
SQLUSER = "your postgres username"
SQLHOST = "host youre running on (its probably localhost)"
SQLDATABASE = "the name of your databse"
SQLPASSWORD = "your sql password"
SQLPORT = the port that sql is running on

Now to run the program, in the same directory run the command: nodemon

In Postman set the method to POST, and use the following URL http://localhost:your_port/manager/insertemployee

Now send the following JSON:

{   
    "manager_username": "log1",
    "company_name": "Google",
    "first_name": "Frank",
    "last_name": "Zappa",
    "username": "defaultLog",
    "password": "somePassword",
    "roles" : ["OFFICE", "REMOTE", "REPAIR"],
    "employment_type": "FULLTIME"
}

You should get a message back "Employee inserted"
This change can be reflected in your database if you query all of the employees, this new employee should be inserted.

If you try to insert again without changing the username you will recieve back: "This username already exists."

If you try to insert another employee using an ID that does not belong to a manager you will recieve this back: "Unauthorized: Not manager!"

If you were to run this again you should get the message back "emp_id already exists." meaning that this employee already exists.
