2. now try using http://localhost:port/user/userData

    {
        "first_name": "Frank",
        "last_name": "Johnson"
    }

You will notice that you will get "message:" "Invalid token."

    {
        "username": "log1",
        "password": "pw1"
    }

Now that you have logged in you should have recieved back this JSON message:
{
    "token": "some jumble of characters (your token)",
    "message": "Success, Welcome Frank. Your role is MANAGER,OFFICE."
}

4. From the JSON copy the token
5. In Postman click on the Authorization tab.

8. Now once again try to access the userData route: http://localhost:port/user/userData

    {
        "first_name": "Frank",
        "last_name": "Johnson"
    }
