How to run:

Firstly once inside the directory run the following command: npm install

Next creat a .env file inside follow this format:
PORT = your port
SQLUSER = "your postgres username"
SQLHOST = "host youre running on (its probably localhost)"
SQLDATABASE = "the name of your databse"
SQLPASSWORD = "your sql password"
SQLPORT = the port that sql is running on

Now to run the program, in the same directory run the command: nodemon

In Postman set the method to POST, and use the following URL http://localhost:your_port/manager/deleteemployee

In the Headers tab add the following key-value pair: "Content-Type": "application/json"

Now send the following JSON:

{   
    "manager_username": "log1",
    "username": "log3"
}

When you run this you will recieve back "Employee deleted."

Run this again and you will recieve "This employee username does not exist."

If you were to alter the manager_username to an employee that is not a manager eg. log2 you will recieve back: "Unauthorized: Not manager!"

In Postman set the method to POST, and use the following URL http://localhost:your_port/manager/editemployee

A manager can edit an employees roles and employment_type all three of these will work depending on what the manager wants to update on an employee

{   
    "manager_username": "log1",
    "username": "log4",
    "roles" : ["OFFICE", "REPAIR"],
    "employment_type": "PARTTIME"
}

{   
    "manager_username": "log1",
    "username": "log4",
    "roles" : ["REMOTE", "REPAIR"],
}

{   
    "manager_username": "log1",
    "username": "log4",
    "employment_type": "FULLTIME"
}
