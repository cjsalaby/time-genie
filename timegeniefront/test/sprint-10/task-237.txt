To test the geofence locations you must log in as an employee, and have geofence data assigned to that employee.
If you do not have geofence data assigned you can just manually assign a region in location-helper.js under the
startGeofencing function.

example:

const region = [{
            identifier: `ASU Poly Academic Center`,
            latitude: 33.30710173441752,
            longitude: -111.67832562600776,
            radius: 300
            notifyOnEnter: true,
            notifyOnExit: true,
        }]

On android and I would guess iOS you can change your location within the emulator. Placing your location within the radius
of the geofence will allow the user to clock in. If they are not inside the region then they cannot clock in.

If a user is clocked and then moves outside the region then they are automatically clocked out.
