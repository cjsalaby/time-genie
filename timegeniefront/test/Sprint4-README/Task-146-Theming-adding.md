before you start with npx expo start
in the command prompt for expo run the command

npm install

Im not sure what commands exactly need to be re ran so here is the list just in case but message me if you need help
The first to run would be poppins

npx expo install @expo-google-fonts/poppins expo-font expo-app-loading

These also may be needed

npx react-native@latest init CustomFontCLI
npx react-native-asset

when running first time i believe that npx expo start will ask for another install to say yes to
After the test should be complete
